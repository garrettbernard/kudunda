Website to upload and group photos by location

Never use this in a production environment!
The upload script isn't protected, so anyone can upload anything with it!
The login script isn't scrubbed, so junk can be injected!

I started building this during college (hence why the code is beyond dreadful 
and is severely hacked up) to basically build a community photo album 
website where pictures could be uploaded and tagged by location or event.

Shortly after starting this I discovered Color (which has crashed and burned 
since then) and I was really trying to achieve the exact same thing except 
I wasn't nearly that good.

So I went back to school and started studying oceanography.
