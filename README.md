Website to upload and group photos by location

I started building this during college (hence why the code is beyond dreadful 
and is severely hacked up) to basically build a community photo album 
website where pictures could be uploaded and tagged by location or event.

Shortly after starting this I discovered Color (which has crashed and burned 
since then) and I was really trying to achieve the exact same thing except 
I wasn't nearly that good.

So I went back to school and started studying oceanography.

But really, this code is shit. Don't use it. Don't even look at it.
I'm embarrassed.
